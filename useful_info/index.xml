      <description>Modding RL is finnicky. You&amp;rsquo;re going to crash the game at some point. This will tell you how to learn from a crash and solve your issue.
Crashes are often logged in .dmp files. They are found at My Documents/My Games/rocketleague/TAGame/Logs
Unfortunately sometimes there is no .dmp file. That often means you crashed in a non-game thread, like rendering or websockets. For those you might just need to do some logging to find out where you crashed</description>

      <description>Netcode plugins are a powerful way to handle asymmetrical multiplayer plugins. It can allow clients to control the match, when normally only the host can. This is much better described in this video by CinderBlock
https://youtu.be/jyFuN8k2uIs
If you want to make your own netcode plugin, there&amp;rsquo;s a template for it just like normal plugins. It does all the setup shown in the above video automatically. Follow the README to install it</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a couple super useful libraries that let you write plugins in other programming languages. We can&amp;rsquo;t really guarantee any tutorials in this server as we don&amp;rsquo;t have anyone with much experience in them. If you use them feel free to add help and make a pull request. You&amp;rsquo;re still welcome to ask for help with them in the discord, but most people here use the standard C++ library and it may be hard to get specific help</description>
